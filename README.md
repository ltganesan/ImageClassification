Image Classification Using Kaggle Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels for test1.zip (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

In this project, I tried training only a few samples (2048) of cat and dog images. I used a VGG16 model trained on the ImageNet dataset as my starting point.
